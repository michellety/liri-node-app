# liri-node-app
Uses the axios package to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
There are four commands that are recognized by this app: "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says", that are then followed by the entertainment search provided by the user. The results are displayed in the terminal.  If no song is selected- the default is The Sign.  No movie entered, the default is Mr. Nobody.
